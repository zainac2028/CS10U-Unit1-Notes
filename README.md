# HTML/CSS/JS Template for CS1

This repository provides a simple **web development template** with `HTML`/`CSS`/`JS` starter code. You can create your own copy by clicking `Use This Template` whenever you need to start a new HTML/CSS/JS program. For **unit notes**, **project instructions**, and **helpful resources**, refer to our course website: üìñ [WebDocs](https://coderina.dev/webdocs/)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è _DO NOT modify the following files:_ `.devcontainer`, `.vscode`, `codeswing.json`.

### üíª Codespaces Instructions
1. Click the green `<> Code` button in the top right area above the list of files
2. Select the `Codespaces` tab and click `Open new Codespace on main`
3. Wait for the Codespace to setup (_it will take some time because VSCode extensions are being installed_)
4. After the extensions load, you will see a **live preview** of the webpages and three panes for the following files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. _Now you're ready to code!_
5. Always make sure to `commit changes` before closing a Codespace!

#### Troubleshooting
If you‚Äôre not seeing any changes in the live preview, you may need to rebuild your container OR close your current Codespace and create a new Codespace to reload your environment. To rebuild your environment, access your [Command Palette](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/codespaces-reference/using-the-vs-code-command-palette-in-codespaces) and choose `Codespaces: Rebuild Container`.
